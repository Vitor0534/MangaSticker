MangaSticker:

This is a project created as a final course work, in the computer engineering course by PUC-GO

MangaSticker is a tool for creating interactive manga by integrating circuit sticker with manga
The purpose of the tool is to provide a modeling environment where you can view the manga and the circuit sticker
concomitantly. Artifacts can be designed using the editing area and tools. The tool
has the option to print interactive mangas on two A4 sheets, one for the manga side and the other
for the circuit side. Once printed, the components must be positioned on the circuit sheet and that sheet
is superimposed with the manga to generate the interactive manga.

As standard, the tool brings some pre-modeled characters and elements of scenarios and inserted in the lists.
Simple circuit elements are also present, such as LEDs, conductive tape and PushButtons


How to run the program:

1- install processing in version 3.5.4 or higher

2- Set your computer's screen resolution to at least 1920 x 1080
           * The program will not run properly at a lower resolution
           * The program was tested only on Windows 10 64bit, however, it is expected that the
             MangaSticker works on any OS with processing installed;
4- Open the code with processing and click on run
5- Enjoy the tool :)


How to use:

The tool consists of two main elements, the editing area and the toolbox:
              * Editing area: consists of two layers, one for the circuit and the other for the manga
              * Toolbox: the toolboxes are used to select the figure and circuit components, they also serve
                         for selecting editing tools;
To make the modeling process it is enough to select figures or circuit components in the toobox
and placed in the editing area. The program separates the layers automatically. Characters and settings can be used
MangaSticker standards, or new elements can be added on the selection screen by clicking on add picture

In the tool there are sample projects, which are the test cases, they can be used as reference and training. also
PDF ready-to-print projects were added
