### Brief explanation

Manga Sticker is a tool to build interactive mangas in form of circuit sticker. 

Its first version was developed during the author's course completion work in 2020, being the product of research into interactive manga for training people with down syndrome. However, the software is not limited to this theme, allowing complete freedom to create interactive manga. More details can be read in the following article:

**How to run the program:**

 - install processing in version 3.5.4 or higher
 - Set your computer's screen resolution to at least 1920 x 1080:
	 - The program will not run properly at a lower resolution
	 - The program was tested only on Windows 10 64bits, however, it is expected that the MangaSticker works on any OS with processing installed; 
- Install the "ControlP5" and "UiBooster" libraries
- Open the code with processing and click on run
- Enjoy the tool :)
